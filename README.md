# Car_Dealership-s_management_sm_project
# I worked on a Python program to simulate a car dealership's inventory management system. 
# The system aims to model cars and their attributes accurately.
# Task-1. task1 with creating a Python program to represent vehicles using a class. 
# Each car should have attributes for maximum speed and mileage.
# Task-2. Update the class with the default color for all vehicles," white".
# Task-3. Additionally, I need to create methods in the Vehicle class to assign seating capacity to a vehicle
#  Task-4. Create a method to display all the properties of an object of the class.
# Task-5. Additionally, I  create two objects of the Vehicle class object that should have a max speed of 200kph and mileage of 50000kmpl with five seating capacities, and another car object should have a max speed of 180kph and 75000kmpl with four seating capacities
